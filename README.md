Find polynomial roots with Jenkinsâ€“Traub algorithm. This Matlab mex-function is using the CPOLY algorithm from ACM Algorithm 419 for polynomials with complex coefficients, and the RPOLY algorithm from ACM Algorithm 493 for polynomials with real coefficients. Both ACM algorithms have been converted from Fortran to C code using F2C. The algorithm calculates all of the zeros of a polynomial whose coefficients are the elements of a vector in order of decreasing powers. Leading zeros in the coefficients are discarded.
